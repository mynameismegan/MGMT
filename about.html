          <p>Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden formed the band while attending Wesleyan University during their freshman year. "We weren't trying to start a band,"
           remarked Goldwasser. "We were just hanging out and showing each other music that we liked." They experimented with noise rock and electronica before settling
           on what Paco Alvarez of Spin calls "their current brand of shape-shifting psychedelic pop.‚Äù The band formed under the name The Management.
           In the autumn of 2006 Maureen Kenny signed the band to Columbia Records.When the band received a call from the A&R department of Columbia Records saying they
           were interested in their music, they thought it was a joke.The duo recorded with Flaming Lips/Sleater-Kinney music producer Dave Fridmann in 2007 for their
           major label debut, Oracular Spectacular.<br>

            MGMT's Congratulations was released on April 13, 2010.  MGMT originally suggested that they might not release any singles from the album. By July 2010, however,
            four single releases from the album had been confirmed. On April 20, 2013, the band released the studio version of "Alien Days". The band then embarked on a
            spring tour, followed by fall/autumn and winter tour dates for North America. On October 17, the band released "Little Dark Age", the title track from their
            new album and their first single in four years. Little Dark Age is both an expression of surprise and dismay to the current political and social climate with
            an occasional reference to their own personal lives. The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States is where the inspiration came. The album
            was released on February 9, 2018 with an upcoming North American tour.
